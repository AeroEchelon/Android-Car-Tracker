# Car Tracker Application

*This is currently a work in progress.*

Please check out the [releases](https://github.com/AeroEchelon/CarTracker/releases) for stable versions of this application.

### Objective

This is a simple Android application that is able to view and control a car alarm from a remote location. It also can track and plot a car's location on a map.

### Details

This application interfaces with the Parse database to store a history of status of the car including it's longitude and latitudinal coordinates as well as it's current alarm state.

If the car's alarm has sounded, a push notification is sent to the mobile device notifying the user of the car's most recent break-in location.
